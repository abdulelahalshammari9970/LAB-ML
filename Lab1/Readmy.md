**Lab 1  Getting started with git and githup**
In this lab, I learned how to upload a local project to GitHub using Git and GitHub Desktop. 

The process included:

Creating a new repository on GitHub (public, initialized with a README).

Cloning the repository to my local machine using GitHub Desktop and terminal commands.

Adding project files (Jupyter Notebook, Python scripts, etc.) to the local folder.

Committing changes with meaningful commit messages.

Pushing commits to the remote repository on GitHub.

Practicing branching and pull requests:

Created a new branch (update-readme).

Made edits and committed.

Opened a pull request on GitHub and merged it into main.
